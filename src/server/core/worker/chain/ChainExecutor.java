/**
 * A {@link ChainExecutor} holds a queue of {@link ChainWorker}s that can be ran
 * in first in first out order. When logic from a worker is executed the next
 * worker waits for its specified delay and then executes its logic, and so on
 * (like a chain) until the end is reached and the executor automatically shuts
 * down (and can be re-ran after). <br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * Factory executors can prove to be extremely useful when doing things that
 * require a lengthy amount of precisely executed workers in a specific order.
 * This is because it only uses <b>one</b> worker to run however many workers it
 * needs to run (rather than having the same amount of workers as there are
 * tasks, which can be a lot!). <br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * An example of usage is provided below: <br>
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * 
 * 
 * If you had this factory executor and following workers appended:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * FactoryExecutor executor = new FactoryExecutor(&quot;our-factory-executor&quot;, Time.SECONDS);
 * 
 * executor.append(new ChainTask() {
 *     ... // lets just say the delay was 3 and it printed &quot;Hello world!&quot;.
 * });
 * 
 * And
 * 
 * executor.append(new ChainTask() {
 *      ... // lets just say the delay was 5 and it printed &quot;Goodbye world!&quot;.
 * });
 * </pre>
 * 
 * If you ran the executor using <code>executor.run()</code> it would result in:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * ... delay for three seconds
 * 
 * print &quot;Hello world!&quot;
 * 
 * ... delay for five seconds
 * 
 * print &quot;Goodbye world!&quot;
 * </pre>
 * 
 * And the executor would shut down allowing for more workers to be appended to
 * the internal queue and the chance to be ran again.
